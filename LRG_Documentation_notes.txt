Overall description:
Intron positions and intron sequences from lrg files too look for things like cryptic splice sites. 
Can pull out all introns to look for cryptic splice sites in the future
Needed because genomic information is being returned and introns are not being looked at and investigated. 

What we need to do today:
•	Look at LRG
•	See about how data is structured
•	And think about what we might need to do
•	Inputs needed
•	Outputs generated
•	Why we want these things
•	How can we improve the code in the future

Notes about what we might need:
Pending approval warning
Make sure that the LRG file is from the correct build – display the sequence
Display reference sequence ID (NM number)

The gene we are using to test with:
PMP22:
•	Involved in inherited peripheral neuropathies
•	5 exons

The LRG website uses RELAX NG schema language for XML. The key features of RELAX NG are that it:
•	is simple
•	is easy to learn
•	has both an XML syntax and a compact non-XML syntax
•	does not change the information set of an XML document
•	supports XML namespaces
•	treats attributes uniformly with elements so far as possible
•	has unrestricted support for unordered content
•	has unrestricted support for mixed content
•	has a solid theoretical basis
•	can partner with a separate datatyping language (such W3C XML Schema Datatypes)

Programs to help make XML more readable:
Dreamweaver
G edit
Notepad ++

•	Import the whole genomic sequence and make it into a list (because lists have position and they are mutable)
•	Test: all ATGC and no other text type
•	Find the coordinates for the exons in the genomic sequence using the xml tags <exon label = ‘1’> <coordinates coord_system = “LRG_number” start =”position” end = “position” strand = “number”> </coordinates> </exon>
•	Test: Use a gene and make sure getting correct values , check the LRG number is same as id LRG number . Make sure strands are correct, i.e. has strand 1 info. 
•	Use a for loop because value will be different in each LRG file
•	Test: Need to make sure that we are getting the correct exon transcript tags make sure in the correct parent and LRG matches the ID at the top
•	Coordinates of transcript and exons tags to find the start and the stop values for the exons. Add the values to variables. Make sure we -1 from the value of each start and stop to take into account that the list will begin from 0 and the transcript will begin from 1
•	Use the start stop variables to pull out (copy not cut) the slices of introns from the genomic  sequence. 
•	Try to put the following into an output file:
	Gene number
	LRG number
	Reference sequence ID
	Build Info
	Intron  number : 
	Start:
	Stop: 
	Intron sequence
