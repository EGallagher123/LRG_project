1) import/parse xml file to make "LRG_file" variable.
2) define a function called "imp_genome" to turn genome sequence into list.
	<fixed annotation>
		<sequence>
3) define a function called "imp_positions" using for loop to get exon positions.
	<fixed annotation>
		<transcript>
			<exon>
			   <coordinates>
4) define a function called "get_intron_positions"
	call "imp_positions" function to get "exon_start" and "exon_end" 
	and return intron positions.
5) define a function called "get_intron_slices"
	call "imp_genome" as genome_list and call intron positions 
	as "intron_start" and "intron_end" to get slices from list.
6) export data into file
